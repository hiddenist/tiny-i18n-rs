I'm currently learning about [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and exploring using it as a frontend web development tool. This project is a tiny localized webpage using [Yew](https://yew.rs/).

## Development

For first-time setup, follow the Getting Started docs for Yew: https://yew.rs/docs/getting-started/introduction

Once you have Trunk running, use `trunk serve` to run the app in development mode.
